Pandas School City Assignment

Conclusions; This data is clearly falsified as the average passing grades are higher as the spending decreases. This is not my opinion, but that of the US DoJ, the NY DoEdu,
and other organisations that monitor charter schools. Charter schools by their very definition are for-profit entities. It is in their interest to have higher performing
scores as compared to their public sector peers. If one is to look at the Finnish class model of 22 students or less, with national average of 19.6 students per class, spending
is around 1300 Euros per student. (https://www.oph.fi/en/news/2019/average-group-sizes-basic-education-finland-below-oecd-average). A cursory Google (R) search of
'Charter School Fraud' or 'Charter School Scandal' will net a plethora of investigations ranging from California to NY. This is BAD data! Any further analysis will have
to be supported by more in-depth grading and scoring schema. As shown that all of the top performing schools are Charter schools. 


2. What follows global trends is that medium and smaller schools do much better than larger schools in overall passing, though it can be seen that the public (district)
schools have exceptionally large student populations. A total school budget does not put into consideration that most of these schools are much older and those have much
of their budget reserved for O&M and other RP Operations, while charter schools are generally leased facilities from municipalities.
